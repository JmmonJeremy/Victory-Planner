      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am now going to school and learning to design webpages. Over the past thirty years I have invested in, read and tried to apply several people’s professional approaches to setting and accomplishing goals. I have found one fatal flaw in all of these approaches. They often leave people feeling overwhelmed and focused on their failures. Do you know people who feel like this? This feeling of dissatisfaction can be very discouraging and prevent people from accomplishing their goals. I want to create a website that possesses some simple and functional tools to help people overcome those feelings of discouragement and replace them with feelings of encouragement. My website will help them to recognize and focus on their successes, not their failures, which will help keep them motivated and moving forward towards their goals.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is the individual. More specifically, my audience is the individual who is struggling to accomplish personal goals that meet personal satisfaction. In particular, I want to reach and affect those striving to accomplish personal goals, but often finding themselves getting discouraged and maybe even at times giving up. I want to reach those whose belief of and hope in personal victory may be on shaky ground. I will target those within this category who are male or female between the ages of 15 and 55 years, but my audience is not necessarily limited by this age range.  </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank">https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel</a>

        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Prosto One  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font to stand out. I wanted the heading to have a bit of a caligraphy look to it. I wanted the heading font to look strong and at the same time have a little bit of a fun look to it. I also like how this font has a somewhat rounded look to it. It makes the letters look like the belong together and are boldly stating their goal.   <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Kalam  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font because I wanted a font that would be a contrast to the heading font. The heading font is san serif and this font is a cursive font. I also wanted this font to look somewhat suffisticated and intelligent. In addition I wanted it to look as close to hand written as possible while still being a legible font for writing paragraphs.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.

        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

      <h4>Roadmap</h4>
      <p>
        Whether we officially set goals or are just working towards things we want, everyone essentially has goals they are working for. Setting goals has become a common practice. Many people shy away from officially setting goals because it can become discouraging and ultimately seem like a waste of time. There are many methods that have been created to try and bring people success in setting and achieving goals. This website uses a unique recipe to help people set goals, achieve them, and feel successful along the way.
      </p>
      <h4>Personal Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        We all come from different backgrounds and view life through different prisms of experience. Our individual circumstances present challenges that are unique to us. We are all dealing with different personal obstacles, and as a result, it does not take the same degree of effort for everyone to achieve the same goal. It can become discouraging if we measure the results of our efforts, without taking into consideration our own personal challenges. Because of this, comparing our results with others results can rob us of hope. 
      </p>
      <h4>Opposition</h4>
      <p>
        Although we all face different challenges, achieving any goal has one common obstacle for all of us. Discouragement or lack of hope is the one obstacle that everyone must avoid or overcome to achieve their goals. Hope is essential to accomplishing our goals. If we do not believe we can accomplish our goals we will not be moved to action. Therefore, cultivating hope and optimism is essential for any goal to be achieved.

      <h3>Compass</h3>
      <h4>Perspective</h4>
      <p>
        Our motivation to act on our goals becomes deflated when we convince ourselves that accomplishing our goal isn’t all that important. Belittling our goals can lead to losing perspective and seeking immediate gratification. Immediate gratification means we are neglecting the big picture to get something we want right now. This short sightedness leads to spending time in frivolous, destructive, or ultimately unfulfilling ways. These actions lead to discouragement. How do we avoid this short sightedness and keep our desires and goals in line with each other?
      </p>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        The importance of a goal remains clear to us when we know how that goal ties into our purpose. Our purpose defines what is important to us in life. We can cultivate our immediate desires by knowing our ultimate goals or purpose in life. Purpose gives our goals, actions, efforts, and work meaning. This meaning is a strong motivator and fuel for action. Fulfillment comes from accomplishing things that line up with our purpose. Knowing our purpose will form a personal compass that will guide the decisions we make day to day and help us to define what our personal success will look like and mean. 
      </p>
      <h4>Paradigm</h4>
      <p>
        Another important step in nurturing hope and belief that achieving your goals is possible is to fill your mind with positive things and develop optimism. This site will provide you with resources for you to collect positive quotes and ideas from books, articles, and other writings or resources. An important step in achieving your goals is to keep your hope and belief alive and growing each day. Establishing the habit of reading and reviewing positive quotes, principles, or ideas daily in some way is a necessary mental exercise for maintaining belief and hope. Personal hope and optimism are a mindset that needs to be replenished each day. This is an important step in reaching any goal.

      <h3>Victories</h3>
      <h4>Expectation</h4>
      <p>
        It is impossible for an individual to even muster a desire to think about giving any effort towards achieving a goal unless hope and belief exist within them that it is possible to achieve that goal. Therefore, a vital step in achieving any goal is to nurture hope and belief within yourself that accomplishing your goals is possible. The question is, how do you do that?
      </p>
      <h4>Evaluation</h4>
      <p>
        A key to developing and growing a personal hope and belief that achieving your goals is possible is to recognize and celebrate your personal efforts and achievements, regardless of the immediate outcome. This could even mean recognizing an effort made that didn’t get the result you wanted. The fact that you tried something and it failed, in the very least means that you learned something. If all you learned is that something doesn’t work, that is a step in the right direction and progress that wasn’t there before. Celebrating your personal successes will help you to focus on and recognize your progress, instead of focusing on what hasn’t happened yet. Eventually those triumphs will yield not only the end result you are striving for, but also the wisdom, character, and ability to produce results like that again and again. Most importantly, celebrating your successes, however small or big, will nurture hope and belief that your goals are possible.
